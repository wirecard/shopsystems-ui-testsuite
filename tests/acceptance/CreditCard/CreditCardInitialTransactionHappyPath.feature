Feature: CreditCardInitialTransactionHappyPath
  As a guest user
  I want to make an initial transaction with a Credit Card
  And to see that initial transaction was successful

  Background:
    Given I initialize shop system
    
  @woocommerce
  Scenario Outline: initial transaction Non 3DS
    #Given I activate "CreditCard" payment action <payment_action> in configuration
    And I prepare checkout with purchase sum <amount> in shop system as "guest customer"
    And I see "Wirecard Credit Card"
    And I start "CreditCard" payment
    When I fill "CreditCard" fields in the shop
    Then I see successful payment
    And I see "CreditCard" transaction type <transaction_type> in transaction table

    Examples:
      | payment_action  | amount | transaction_type |
      |    "reserve"    |  "20"  |  "authorization" |
      |      "pay"      |  "20"  |    "purchase"    |
